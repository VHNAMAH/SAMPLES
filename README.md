> MSCC MEETUP (2024/01): .NET MAUI AND LOTTIE ANIMATIONS

## Animations in .NET MAUI
As part of the Developers' Conference 2023 (MU), I presented how to use .NET MAUI and the Animations feature to create some interesting animated components.

Custom animations are great, especially when dealing with user interactions - but in some situations, it can be interesting to simply have an animated image (think GIF) in the application.

A basic animated image can:
- Spice up the application with no use whatsoever   
  E.g. A smiling avatar on a login or signup page

- Provide some visual context of what you are doing   
  E.g. An animated cart that triggers everytime something is added

- Indicate that something is happening   
  E.g. An animated card reader to show payment was successful
